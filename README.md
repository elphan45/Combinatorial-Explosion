# Combinatorial Explosion

This repository contains experiments and examples to demonstrate the concept of combinatorial explosion in computer science and its implications when using brute force search algorithms.

## What is Combinatorial Explosion?

Combinatorial explosion refers to the rapid growth of computational complexity when dealing with problems that involve multiple combinations of elements. As the number of elements increases, the number of possible combinations grows exponentially.
